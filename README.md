## What is Advent of Code?
[Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), the creator of the Advent of Code challenge [describes it as](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about):
> An Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
